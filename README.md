# Carpool

## Description

Carpool app is a cross platform app that can help to reduce carbon footprint by sharing car ride for people travelling on same route as of driver. This app is currently a MVP where a rider can request for ride to a driver that is currently driving for the same origin and destination location. The long term vision of this app is to solve problems like insecurity(by scanning government ID of drivers and riders for safety), close pickup location for riders (by enforcing 0.5 mile walk distance policy) and helping people use free electic bikes to minimize the walking distance for riders.

Carpool app has two separate UIs: Driver and Rider. Drivers have the ability to start/cancel a ride and during there ongoing drive they can received incoming request from the riders for a ride. Drivers can either accept/reject the request based on the drivers will. Riders have the ability to find a new ride and wait till there request gets accepted/rejected.
